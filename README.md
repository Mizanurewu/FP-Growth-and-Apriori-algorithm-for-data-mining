# FP-Growth-and-Apriori-algorithm-for-data-mining
In Data Mining, Association Rule Mining is a standard and well researched technique for locating fascinating relations between variables in large databases. Association rule is used as a precursor to different Data Mining techniques like classification, clustering and prediction. To measure the performance of the Apriori algorithm and Frequent Pattern (FP) growth algorithm by comparing their capabilities in different datasets. The evaluation study shows that the FP-growth algorithm is efficient and ascendable than the Apriori algorithm has many differentiative approach for serving reslts. Here, we are analysing chess and mushroom datasets in terms of apriori and fp growth algorithm.
